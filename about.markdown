I'm a career transitioner from philosophy/education to software development. I've worked as an English teacher in San Francisco and Taiwan for six years, teaching both adults and children from all walks of life. I began learning coding in 2023, working through _Python for Everybody_ and _How To Design Programs_. In Fall 2024 I enrolled in the University of Colorado at Boulder's postbacc program in Computer Science, where I will take my second degree in May 2026.
