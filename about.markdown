I'm an interdisciplinarian - I have a background in literature and philosophy yet recently studied computer science and mathematics. What unites these for me is a passion for understanding foundations. In undergrad, I took natural language to be a kind of foundation of humanity, and literature as a window into a culture's foundations. Later, I taught English both in the US and abroad, learning much about other cultures as well as my own. More recently, I decided to take on computer science and mathematics, as both an extension of my training in formal philosophy (symbolic logic) and an opportunity to expand my career. I'm currently looking for careers in software engineering.

<!-- Sounds a little whimsical for a software engineer? More appropriate for a researcher.... 
     We expect software engineers to be a bit more hard-nosed. But how to present my story in
     that way authentically?
     Focus on work experience, self-employment with tutoring, passion for learning and building;
     connect designing lessons with designing programs.
