# ConnectN

This project was part of a Programming Workshop class at CU Boulder focusing on Software Design. I developed an event-driven GUI version of the popular board game Connect-4 ... with some twists. Players can choose different board sizes, and have special abilities to clear rows and columns and convert opponent disks. There's a timer that counts down during each move. 

__Built with C++ and Qt 6.3.9__
